Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model written in Python.

This package endeavors to create a simple API for automating the creation
of [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis_of_information_risk) Monte Carlo risk simulations.

This is based in large part on:
1) [the Technical Standard published by the Open Group](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919899/toc.pdf); and,
2) [Measuring and Managing Information Risk](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Managing-Information-Risk-Approach-ebook/dp/B00N9YPW5C/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Measuring+and+Managing+Information+Risk%3A+A+FAIR+Approach&qid=1559271904&s=gateway&sr=8-1).
